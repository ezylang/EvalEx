# EvalEx Documentation

For documentation, EvalEx uses GitHub Pages, which uses Jekyll to transform markdown to static HTML.

The sites HTML is generated automatically whenever something is committed to the main branch.

Jekyll will transform all files it finds in the "docs" directory. This may take a few minutes,
depending on the overall GitHub load.

For the layout the _JustTheDocs_ template is used, which supports a lot of good things like a sidebar
menu, page hierarchy and searching.
