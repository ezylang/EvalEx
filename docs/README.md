# EvalEx Documentation

For documentation, EvalEx uses GitHub Pages, which uses Jekyll to transform markdown to static HTML.

The site HTML is generated whenever something is committed to the main branch.

Jekyll will then transform all files it finds in the "docs" directory.

For the layout the JustTheDocs template is used, which supports a lot of good things like a sidebar
menu, page hierarchy and searching.
